    arbitrator to be appointed in accordance with the Act. The place of
    both mediation and arbitration shall be Bangalore, India. The
    language of the mediation and/or arbitration shall be English,
    unless you do not speak English, in which case the mediation and/or
    arbitration shall be conducted in both English and your native

    proceedings, including documents and briefs submitted by the
    parties, any correspondence from the mediator, and correspondence,
    orders and awards issued by the sole arbitrator, shall remain
    strictly confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party
    without the express written consent from the other party unless: (i)
    the disclosure to the third party is reasonably required in the
    context of conducting the mediation or arbitration proceedings; and
    (ii) the third party agrees unconditionally in writing to be bound
    by a confidentiality obligation stipulated herein.</FONT></FONT></P>
